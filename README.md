# Whispr - Web3 Audio Call

Whispr is a web3 audio call platform built with Next.js, WebRTC (peerJS). 
It allows users to make secure and encrypted audio calls to each other.

Today It is working with a PeerJS centralized server to manage the signals.

Next steps:
- Study Waku Protocol, examples<https://github.com/waku-org/examples.waku.org>
- Implement signals with Waku
